## Abstract

## Motivation: why is this CIP necessary?

[Consensus](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus) is one of the components of the [Cardano node][cardano-node].
TODO: should we sumarize the information described [here](https://ouroboros-consensus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/docs/about-ouroboros/)?

We need this CIP to:
<!-- TODO: remove the ones that do not apply, add more if needed -->

- Encourage new collaborators.
- Give guidance for future CIPs that aim at changing Consensus, making it a registered category of the CIP process.
- Give a taxonomy of Consensus changes and prescibe processes for proposing such changes.
- Standardize the process by which Consensus is updated (with new features or fixes).
- Serve as reference to other Cardano node implementations (different from the [de facto one](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node)).
